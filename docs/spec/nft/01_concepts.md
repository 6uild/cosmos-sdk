# Concepts

## NFT

The `NFT` Interface inherits the BaseNFT struct and includes getter functions for the asset data. It also lincludes a Stringer function in order to print the struct. The interface may change if metadata is moved to itâ€™s own module as it might no longer be necessary for the flexibility of an interface.

```go
// NFT non fungible token interface
type NFT interface {
  GetID() string
  GetOwner() sdk.AccAddress
  SetOwner(address sdk.AccAddress)
  GetName() string
  GetDescription() string
  GetImage() string
  GetTokenURI() string
  EditMetadata(name, description, image, tokenURI string)
  String() string
}
```

## Collections

A Collection is used to organized sets of NFTs. It contains the denomination of the NFT instead of storing it within each NFT. This saves storage space by removing redundancy.

```go
// Collection of non fungible tokens
type Collection struct {
  Denom string `json:"denom,omitempty"` // name of the collection; not exported to clients
  NFTs  NFTs   `json:"nfts"`            // NFTs that belong to a collection
}
```

## Owner

An Owner is a struct that includes information about all NFTs owned by a single account. It would be possible to retrieve this information by looping through all Collections but that process could become computationaly prohibitive so a more efficient retrieval system is to store redundant information limited to the token ID by owner.

```go
// Owner of non fungible tokens
type Owner struct {
  Address       sdk.AccAddress `json:"address"`
  IDCollections IDCollections  `json:"IDCollections"`
}
```
